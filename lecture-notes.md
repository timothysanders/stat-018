## Representativeness
- Most important factor of a sample from a population is its representativeness
- Populations have parameters, samples have statistics

## Sampling
- process of selecting a sample from a much larger population
- Different types of sampling methods
  - Random sample (this is basically impossible)
    - Sample in which each member has an equal chance of being chosen
    - Issues
      - Often not possible to identify every member of the population
      - Usually cannot have access to every member of the population
      - Individuals selected for inclusion need to be put back into the population for possible reselection
      - Individuals can refuse to participate and once people refuse, you no longer have a "random" sample
      - "volunteer bias" people who agree to participate in studies often differ in important ways from people who do not participate
  - Systematic sample
    - For example, selecting every 10th name on your list
  - Convenience sample
    - People who are convenient to us
    - Research are typically done on convenience samples
- Stratified sample
  - Any sample can be stratified, means the proportion of individuals with certain characteristics in the sample matches the proportion of people in the population
  - Stratification is typically only done on one or two characteristics
  - Adding more stratification makes it more and more difficult to create stratified samples
- Random Sampling Process
  - Process in which every participant selected for inclusion in the study has an equal probability of being selected
  - Note that this is different from a "random sample", as people have a right to refuse
  - Random sampling process require being able to identify all members of a population

## Probability
- Involves knowing everything about the population and estimating what the sample will look like
  - For example, you know what the cards in a deck are

## Inferential statistics
- Involves knowing everything about the sample and making estimates about what the population looks like
- Opposite of probability

## Variable
- Variables have to be able to "vary", cannot be "constant" values
- Has to vary in the context in which you are talking about, not in general
  - For example, if a class is entirely women, then gender would not be a variable for that class
- Independent variable
  - Variable with a cause outside the scope of the study
  - Researchers determine what the levels are for the study, but study does not tell us anything about the cause
- Dependent variable
  - Values depend upon the independent variable 
  - Has to be numerically measured
  - If there is no independent variable, there cannot be a dependent variable
- In order to run a study, you must have at least one independent variable and one dependent variable

## Discrete vs Continuous Variables
- Continuous variable can take on any value within a certain range
  - For example, GPA is continuous between 0.0 and 4.0
  - Age is another example of a continuous variable
- Discrete value has places where it does and does not exist
  - For example, with letter grades, you have A B C D F, without continuous things in between
- Continuous variables can be made into discrete variables, but the other way is not possible
  - You can reduce the precision of a continuous 

## Quantitative vs Qualitative variables
- Quantitative variables are variables that take on an amount
  - These variables can be either discrete or continuous
- Qualitative variables differ in kind
  - These variables are always discrete
  - Ex: types of therapy, behavior therapy, CBT, DBT, etc.

## Research Variables
- Important variable types are independent and dependent variables
- Studies involve systematically varying one or more variables in order to measure the effects of this variation on one or more other variables
- Variables that are systematically varied are called independent variables
  - These independent variables must be made categorical, cannot be continuous
- Variables that are measured are called dependent variables
- Independent and Dependent variables are operationally defined
  - Number of levels and specific levels to include
  - Three main components of putting participants in levels of the independent variable
    - Will different participants be in each different level or will the same people be in each different level

## Between Subjects IV vs Within Subjects IV
- Between subjects: completed unrelated people in different levels
  - If 20 people, 10 randomly assigned to one, 10 randomly assigned to the other
- Within subjects: same people or a relationship between people in other levels
  - If 10 people, all assigned to both levels
  - If 10 pairs of siblings, and one sibling in each level
  - If 20 people given IQ test, created 10 matched pair, then put one from each pair in each level
  - Must have a 1:1 relationship between subjects to have this within subjects relationship

## Dependent Variables
- Must be numerically measured in order to determine the effect of varying the independent variable
- Dependent variable must be measured in exactly the same way for each level of the independent variable

## Explained vs Unexplained Variation
- Explained
  - Difference between the means of the different groups
- Unexplained
  - How much people in each group differ from one another
- All test statistics are a ratio of the explained to unexplained variation
- Explained variation has to be larger than the unexplained variation

## Extraneous and Confounding Variables
- Extraneous variable is anything that varies besides the independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV)
  - Most extraneous variables don't matter
  - For example, if studying aggression in children playing video games, height or weight are probably extraneous variables
- Confounding variable is an extraneous variable that is confounded with a level of the IV (independent variable)
  - For example, if all boys were in one group and all girls were in another group
  - Some confounding variables we worry about, others we don't
- Confounding variable is by definition an extraneous variable, while an extraneous variable may or may not be confounding
- Can only talk about causation if randomly assigning people to different groups

## Predictor and Criterion Variables
- Predictor variable does the predicting
- Criterion variable gets predicted
- For example, if looking at number of miles commuted and student's GPA
  - Number of miles commuted is the predictor variable
  - GPA is the criterion variable

## Scales of Measurement
- Four scales of measurement
  - Numbers don't always mean the same thing, depends on the scale of measurement
  - *When getting into statistics, everything we do depends on the scales of measurement and being able to determine which is which*
- **Nominal**
  - Unordered categories
  - Lowest scale of measurement
  - Ex: gender, Male - 1, Female - 2, Transgender - 3
    - Ethnicity, gender, types of TV shows, brands of cars, different video games
    - Does not have an "objective order"
  - Only mathematical operation we can do with nominal scales of measurement is equivalence
  - Measure of central tendency: Mode
    - "average" with nominal data really means the mode
  - This is a qualitative scale
    - Categories are discrete
- **Ordinal**
  - Ordered categories (with an objective ordering)
  - One level is higher than another
  - Ex grades: A is higher than B, B is higher than C, etc.
  - Mathematical operations can be equivalence as well as greater than or less than
  - Measure(s) of central tendency: Mode, Median
  - This is a qualitative scale
    - Categories are discrete
- **Interval**
  - Ordered categories
  - Equal size intervals
  - 0 is not the absence of the characteristic; "arbitrary zero point"
    - Ex, 0 temperature does not mean "no temperature"
  - Mathematical operations
    - equal, greater than, less than, add/subtract, mean
    - Cannot multiply/divide
  - Measure(s) of central tendency: Mode, Median, Mean
  - This is a quantitative scale
    - Can be discrete or continuous
- **Ratio**
  - Ordered categories
  - Equal size intervals
  - 0 means the absence of that characteristic; "true zero point"
    - Ex, 0 inches in length or 0 inches in height
  - Mathematical operations
  - equal, greater than, less than, add/subtract, mean, multiply/divide
  - Measure(s) of central tendency: Mode, Median, Mean
  - This is a quantitative scale
    - Can be discrete or continuous
- In terms of statistics, interval & ratio are the same scale
  - Nominal, ordinal, and interval/ratio
- Three questions to determine scale
  - Are the categories ordered?
    - If no, you know it is nominal data
    - If yes, continue
  - Are the intervals equal sized?
    - If no, you know it is ordinal
    - If yes, continue
  - Is there a true zero?
    - If no, it is interval
    - If yes, it is ratio

## Basic Mathematical Operations
### Order of operations
- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication & Division
- Addition & Subtraction
- *Always work from left to right for operations in the same level*
- Parentheses can be used to change the "natural order" of the order of operations
- Goal is to simplify everything to addition/subtraction
### Commutative Properties
- Commutative Property of Multiplication
  - When an operation is all multiplication, order does not matter
    - `2 * 3 * 4 == 4 * 3 * 2`
- Commutative Property of Addition
  - When an operation is all addition, order does not matter
    - `2 + 3 + 4 == 4 + 3 + 2`
- There are no commutative properties for division or subtraction
### Exponents
- Exponent indicates repeated multiplication
