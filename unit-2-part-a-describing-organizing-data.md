# Unit 2: Describing and Organizing Data - Central Tendency and Dispersion

| Scale of Data                               | Central Tendency | Variability         |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Interval / Ratio w/no outliers              | mean             | s, s<sup>2</sup>    |
| Interval / Ratio w/outliers, but don't care | mean             | s, s<sup>2</sup>    |
| Interval / Ratio w/outliers, but do care    | median           | IQR                 |
| Ordinal                                     | Median           | IQR                 |
| Nominal                                     | Mode             | Index of Dispersion |

- When reporting mean, **ALWAYS** report standard deviation and variance (s and s<sup>2</sup>)
- When reporting median, **ALWAYS** report Interquartile Range (IQR)

## Mode
- `mode`: name of category with the highest frequency
- Not a measure of the "center" of the data
- Important to remember that mode is **NOT** the frequency, it is the name of the category with the highest frequency

## Index of Dispersion
- If no dispersion in the data, the value is 0
  - This would mean that all values are in the same category, with no one else in other categories
- If there is maximum dispersion, then the value is 1
  - Exact same number of values in every category
- Proportion of maximum dispersion
  - If value is 0.7, data is "70% maximally dispersed"
- To calculate dispersion
  1. Get total number of values in all categories (N)
  2. Get N<sup>2</sup>
  3. Count number of categories (K)
  4. Get sum of the frequencies squared (Î£*fi*<sup>2</sup>)

## Z-scores
- Allows you to compare different data sets, as long as they are normally distributed
- Z-scores can be used to translates from one distribution to another
  - For example, if someone has a z-score of 1.0 in another distribution
    - x = x-bar + (s<sub>new</sub>)(z<sub>old</sub>)
- Z-score percentile ranks
  - Based on the normal curve
  - Normal curves are symmetric, with mean, median, and mode at the same location

## Python Code
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

array_one = np.array([7, 7, 7, 3, 1])
stats.kurtosis(array_one)
stats.skew(array_one)
stats.moment(array_one, 3)
stats.moment(array_one, 4)

def find_quartile_values(array):
    """
    Find the given quartile value for an array with an odd number of elements.
    """
    def find_quartile_location(quartile_array, quartile):
        quartile_location = quartile * (len(quartile_array) / 4)
        return quartile_location
    
    def get_lower_real_limit(number):
        return number - 0.5
    result_json = {}
    for loc in [1, 2, 3]:
        location = find_quartile_location(array, loc)
        location_value = np.sort(array)[int(location // 1)]
        quartile_value = get_lower_real_limit(location_value) + (location % 1)
        result_json[f"Q{loc}"] = {"location": location, "value": quartile_value}
    result_json["IQR"] = result_json["Q3"]["value"] - result_json["Q1"]["value"]
    return result_json
```
