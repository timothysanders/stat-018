### Chapter 1: Statistics and Scientific Method
#### Introduction
- How can we find out the truth about the world or ourselves in some manner?
- Much of our lives are spent seeking and acquiring the truth
#### Methods of Knowing
- Typically four different methods of acquiring knowledge, or knowing
- **Authority**
    - Something is considered to be true because of tradition or someone distinguished says so
    - For example, our professor said so, therefore it is true
    - This method is seen as being in disfavor, but it is still used a lot because we may not have time/expertise to validate something
        - Examples being that electrons exist because physics authorities tell me so, I believe that smoking is bad because the surgeon general tells me so
- **Rationalism**
    - Uses reasoning alone to arrive at knowledge
    - Assumption is that if the premises are sound and reasoning is done correctly (according to logic), then conclusions will lead to truth
    - Reasoning process is extremely important, but there are situations where it is not completely adequate to determine truth
    - Relying on reason/rationalism alone cannot help us if we do not know if the premises are sound
- **Intuition**
    - Meaning, the sudden insight or clarifying idea that springs into consciousness all at once
    - Intuitive ideas may often occur after conscious reasoning has failed and the individual has put the problem aside for some time
    - Intuition is still a mysterious process, we don't understand much about why it happens
    - Think how you go to sleep and then wake up knowing the answer to your problem
- **Scientific Method**
    - The scientific method incorporates reason, but does not rely only on it. It also incorporates intuition
    - Main differentiator is the scientific method's reliance on objective assessment
    - Experiments are conducted where a hypothesis is established (either through rationalism or intuition) and then an experiment is designed to objectively test the hypothesis
    - Data collected is then analyzed and the hypothesis is either supported or rejected
    - Scientific methodology means any assertions about reality must be demonstrated before they are considered truth
    - This method may be slow, but does have a high probability of yielding truth over the long run
#### Definitions
- `population`: population is a complete set of individuals, objects, or scores that the investigator is interested in studying.
- `sample`: a sample is a subset of a population.
- `variable`: a variable is any property or characteristic of some event, object, or person that may have different values at different times depending on the conditions.
- `independent variable`: the independent variable in an experiment is the variable that is systematically manipulated by the investigator.
- `dependent variable`: the dependent variable in an experiment is the variable that the investigator measures to determine the effect of the independent variable.
- `data`: the measurements that are made on the subjects of an experiment are called data.
- `statistic`: a statistic is a number calculated on sample data that quantifies a characteristic of the sample
- `parameter`: a parameter is a number calculated on population data that quantifies a characteristic of the population
#### Scientific Research and Statistics
- Scientific research can be divided into two categories: observational studies and true experiments
- **Observational Studies**
    - No variables are actively manipulated by the investigators
    - Because of this, observational studies cannot determine causality
    - Three subcategories
        - Naturalistic observation
            - major goal is to obtain an accurate description of the situation being studied
        - Parameter estimation
            - conducted on samples to estimate the level of one or more population characteristics
            - Examples being surveys, marketing research, public opinion polling
        - Correlational studies
            - Focused on two or more variables to determine whether they are related
            - Example being, measuring body fat and blood pressure for adults over 30, do these variables have a relationship?
- **True Experiments**
    - In this research, attempt is made to determine whether changes in one variable cause changes in another variable
    - Independent variable is manipulated and its effect on the dependent variable is studied
    - Can have more than one independent variable and more than one dependent variable, though simplest is one of each
#### Random Sampling
- In research, data is usually collected from a sample, rather than the entire population
- Ideally, data would be collected on the entire population, but this is usually far too costly
- Samples however, should be random, which means that the laws of probability apply to the data and help achieve a representative sample of the population
    - If we can achieve a representative sample, we can say that our results should apply to the population
#### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Statistical analysis is divided into two areas, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics
- Both of these involve analyzing data
- **Descriptive Statistics**
    - concerned with the techniques that are used to describe or characterize the obtained data
    - Done for the purpose of describing or characterizing data
    - Other descriptive statistics might involve the *central tendency* or the *variability* or the *shape* of the data
- **Inferential Statistics**
    - involves techniques that use the obtained sample data to infer to populations
    - Embraces techniques that allow one to use obtained sample data to draw conclusions/make inferences about populations
    - This is the more complicated part of statistical analysis, involves probability and inference tests, like *Student's t test* and *analysis of variance*
#### Using Computers in Statistics
- Usage of computers in statistics has grown greatly, almost all research data in behavioral sciences are analyzed by computer programs
- Computers can save time and labor, minimize the chance of errors, allow easy display of data, etc.
#### Statistics and the "Real World"
- Statistics has very important and practical applications to real life
