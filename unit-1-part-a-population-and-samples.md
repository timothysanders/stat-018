# Unit 1 Part A - What are Statistics and Why are they Needed?
## Video Notes
### Video 1: Crash Course Statistics Preview
- Video link: https://youtu.be/zouPoc49xbk
- Statistics are everywhere!
  - Sports, lottery, etc.
  - Insurance rates, research study effectiveness
  - Marketing, stocking, pricing, etc.
  - Siri, Alexa, etc.
- Statistics are meant to help find the truth, to find simplicity in complexity
- Statistics are about our world and the people in it 
### Video 2: What is Statistics
- Video link: https://youtu.be/sxQaBpKfDRk
- Why do we use statistics and how?
- Statistics is about making sense of data
- "Field of statistics" - study and practice of analyzing data
- "Statistics" - facts about, or summaries of data
- "Proxy" - something related to what we want to measure, but isn't exactly what we want to measure
- What can statistics do?
  - Statistics are tools that can help us make determinations about data in the world
  - We need to understand how to use the tools at our disposal
- Descriptive vs inferential statistics
  - Descriptive
    - usually includes things like where the middle of the data is (measures of central tendency) and measures of how spread out the data is
    - make data we get more digestible
  - Inferential
    - Allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have access to
    - Lets us test an idea or hypothesis
    - Allows us to make these decisions when we have uncertainty 
### Video 3: Mathematical Thinking
- Video link: https://youtu.be/tN9Xl1AcSv8
- Statistics are math
- Mathematical thinking means seeing beyond our "gut thinking"
- Once numbers get extremely large, we lose our ability to easily reason about them
- Can start to have reference points for larger numbers
- Scientific notation can be helpful for calculating big numbers, but exponents can be non-intuitive
- Law of truly large numbers
  - If you have extremely large numbers, you eventually have very unlikely things that can happen
- Law of very small numbers
  - Worth taking time to put small numbers in context
- Thinking mathematically means asking questions about the world around us and using numbers to think about the answers
### Video 4: Populations and Samples
- Video link: https://youtu.be/eIZD1BFfw8E
- Population vs sample
- population (`N`)
  - Collection of all items of interest to our study
  - Numbers obtained when working with a population are called "parameters"
  - Populations are hard to define and hard to observe in real life
- Sample (`n`)
  - A subset of the population
  - Numbers obtained when working with a sample are called "statistics"
  - Easier to contact, less time-consuming, less costly
- Random sample
  - Collected when each member is chosen by chance (equally likely)
- Representative sample
  - Subset of population which accurately reflects the entire population
- After you have some experience, you can recognize if a sample is representative
- Statistical tests are also capable of working with incomplete data
### Video 5: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Video link: https://youtu.be/SFPGVTThJNk
- Statistics is science of collecting and analyzing data
- Sampling methods
  - How we collect our data
  - Extremely important area as the rest of our statistical process depends on having a good sample
- Descriptive statistics
  - Summarizing or highlighting important aspects of our data
- Inferential statistics
  - Making predictions from our data
- Additional topics
  - When to apply a particular formula or method?
  - Probability
  - etc.

#### Question 24 - 27
- Text: Scenario 1: A researcher investigates the effects of Caffeine (350 mg, 0 mg) and Color of Paper (Red, Green, Yellow) on Test Performance.  Two-hundred college undergraduates are randomly assigned to drink 350 mg of caffeine (n = 100) or to drink 0 mg of caffeine (n = 100).  All participants read three passages and took a 50-item multiple choice exam on each passage.  Each multiple-choice exam was printed on one of three colors (Red, Green, and Yellow).  Each participant took one exam printed on each color of paper.  Counterbalancing was used such that across all participants, each exam was printed on each color of paper.  The order of passages and exams was also counterbalanced using complete counterbalancing.  The mean total exam scores were compared for each of the six experimental conditions.  The researcher believes that time of day might affect the results and therefore conducted each experimental condition at 8:00 am in the morning.

Each participant is asked to estimate the number of cups of coffee they drink per week and is asked to self-report their cumulative college GPA.  The researcher then calculates a measure of association in order to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between Caffeine Consumption and Academic Performance.  Furthermore, the researcher hopes to be able to predict Academic Performance from Caffeine Caffeine Consumption.
