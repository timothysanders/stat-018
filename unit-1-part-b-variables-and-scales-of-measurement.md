# Unit 1 Part B - Introduction to Statistical Concepts: Variables and Scales of Measurement

## Lecture Notes
### Exponents
- Any number raised to the zero power is 1
- Exponents raised to exponents
  - Ex: `(2^4)^2` becomes the same as `2^8`
- Multiplying numbers raised to exponents
  - This only works when the bases are the same
  - Combine the bases and add the exponents
  - Ex: `5^3 * 5^3` is the same as `5^6`
  - If the bases are not the same, cannot combine the numbers in this way
- Dividing numbers raised to exponents
  - If you have the same bases, you can combine the bases and subtract the exponents
  - Must subtract the denominator exponent from the numerator exponent
  - Ex: (4<sup>8</sup>)/(4<sup>5</sup>) is the same as 4<sup>8-5</sup>, or 4<sup>3</sup> 
- Numbers multiplied in Parentheses in Exponents
  - Ex: (ab)<sup>y</sup> = a<sup>y</sup>b<sup>y</sup>

### Parentheses
- Parentheses are used to change the "natural" order of the orders of operation
### Commutative Property of Multiplication
- Order of multiplication does not matter
  - a * b * c is the same as c * b * a
- This property does not exist for division
### Associative Property of Multiplication
- It doesn't matter where you put the parentheses for multiplying numbers together
- This is a function of the commutative property
- a * (b * c) is the same as (a * b) * c
- This property does not exist for division
### Commutative Property of Addition
- It does not matter which order we add numbers in
- This property does not exist for subtraction
### Associative Property of Addition
- It does not matter where you put parentheses when adding numbers together
- This property does not exist for subtraction
### Distributive Property
- Multiplication over addition
  - Ex: 2(3 + 4) = 2 * 3 + 2 * 4 = 2(7) = 14
- Multiplication over subtraction
  - Ex: 2(3 - 4) = 2 * 3 - 2 * 4 = 2(-1) = -2
- Can distribute the number outside the parentheses to any number that is inside the parentheses that is being added/subtracted
- "Factoring" is the process of reversing the distributive property
  - Ex: 6 + 8 - 10 + 4 = 2 * 3 + 2 * 4 - 2 * 5 + 2 * 2 = 2(3 + 4 - 5 + 2)

### Summation Sign
- See page 27 in textbook for description
- Scalar variable is a variable that can take on one value only
  - This is the type of variable that people might commonly think of
  - Ex: 2a = 10
- Vector/Matrix variables
  - Summation sign can be used with both vectors and matrices
- Summation sign is noted by the capital greek letter sigma
  - `∑`
- Summation sign for vectors
  - The top number (over ∑) is where to "stop" in the vector
  - The bottom statement (*i = ...*) is where to "start" in the vector
  - ![Summation equation](./images/summation-equation.png)
  - ![Summation example](./images/summation-example.png)
- Largest index in a vector is referred to as N
  - So if our vector is [2, 3, 4, 5] then N = 5
- When adding all numbers, often the convention is to leave off the "counter" and just write ∑x<sub>i</sub> 
- Summation sign and order of operations
  - Parentheses
  - Exponents
  - Multiplication / Division
  - **Summation Sign**
  - Addition / Subtraction
- NOTE THAT THE SUMMATION SIGN IS A UNIT
  - So this means that for `∑x * 2`, you take the sum of x, then multiply by two, because `∑x` is a unit
    - However, the distributive property means that `∑x * 2` is the same as `∑(x * 2)`
